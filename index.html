<h2>Getting to know me</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I am the oldest of 3.</li>
    <li>I am child of God, and I love My Father.</li>
    <li>I am married to Elmorris Still, III for 27 years, which is more than half my life.</li>
    <li>I have naturally birth four bountiful blessings.</li>
    <li>I am native Atlantan, born and raised, a GA Peach, and Grady Baby. </li>
    <li>I don't drink alcohol or coffee, have never done any illegal drugs, can't stand smoke of an kind.</li>
    <li>I absolutely adores DOLPHINS.</li>

<h2>My food favs</h2>
        <li>I love shrimp and salmon. Yet let me tell you, if it's on the menu, I am ordering that calamari and more specifically, the rings.  In my honest opinion and to date of those I've tasted, Atlanta Fish Market has the best of all of these. 
        <li>If I could, spinach and mushrooms would be in every course, in a salad, sauteed, in an omelette, and a smoothie. 
        <li>If I could, I'd eat brunch as my choice meal at any time of the day.  So versatile!</li>
        <li>Immo get me some ice cream, and I have my sons feening for it as well.  It will be found.</li>
